This is a hacky java application to allow me to control a delcom light when a user performs a command in twitch chat.  I designed this for use with deepbot where the command writes to a custom log file the color to turn the light then that is parsed out with the file watcher and calls the appropriate controller script.  This was written in about 30 minutes and likely will never get touched again.  After compiling to run supply the absolute path to the file you wish to watch.
